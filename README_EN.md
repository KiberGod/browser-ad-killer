<h3>General information</h3>

---
YouAd Killer is a browser extension that automatically detects and blocks ads on YouTube.

It should be noted that the extension has both a number of advantages and a number of disadvantages. The advantages include:
* conditionally instant ad skipping (see "How it works")
* is not recognized by YouTube services as an AdBlock extension
* works correctly only at video speed "1"

Disadvantages:
* affects Internet traffic
* cannot work properly at slow Internet speeds

<br>
<h3>Installation and first launch</h3>

---
After installation, it is recommended to completely restart the browser by closing all old tabs. This will guarantee stable
operation of the extension. Otherwise, small anomalies may be detected on the old tabs (exactly where YouTube is open).
You do not need to repeat these steps later, during use.

<br>
<h3>History of creation</h3>

---
The decision to create this extension was made because of YouTube's innovations. They added an AdBlock extension detector and require users to disable them.
After 3 warnings, they block the video player until the user complies with their request.

> In the end, it really upset me and I said: "Okay YouTube, challenge accepted."

<br>
<h3>How it works</h3>

---
YouAd Killer is based on 2 methods of interaction with YouTube:
1. Analyzing the HTML code used to detect ads.
2. Reloading the YouTube page.

These actions are available to any user and are part of the standard functionality of browsers, so the extension does not violate YouTube's policy.

When an ad appears, certain characteristic changes occur in the HTML code of the page, which are recorded by YouAd Killer. After that, the extension instantly reloads the
the page instantly, taking into account the time progress of the video. Since YouTube ads are sent to the user dynamically and at random moments, this algorithm is perfect for
for bypassing ads. Given a fast and unlimited Internet connection, users will enjoy a comfortable video viewing experience with fast and automated ad skipping.

<b>Attention: If you have a slow or very limited Internet connection, the extension will not have the desired effect and can only harm your traffic!</b>
